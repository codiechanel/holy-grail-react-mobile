# holy-grail-react-mobile

This is the same as my previous package holy-grail-react but with the additional support for mobile.

The goal of this layout is not to have a browser scrollbar no matter what the size of the browser window is, or how much content is displayed.

The layout always occupies the whole browser window, and is responsive towards viewport changes. 

It is based on flexbox, and relies on the div to provide the scroll instead of the browser scrollbar.
